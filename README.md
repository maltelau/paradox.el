# Emacs mode to edit [paradox](http://wikis.paradoxplaza.com/) mod files. Adapted for lsp-mode and cwtools

Forked base package def from `Drup/paradox`. Requires a local lsp server binary from `cwtools/cwtools-vscode`.

# TODO
- [x] adapt major mode
- [ ] check that we're using all capabilities of cwtools
- [ ] install instructions and packaging
